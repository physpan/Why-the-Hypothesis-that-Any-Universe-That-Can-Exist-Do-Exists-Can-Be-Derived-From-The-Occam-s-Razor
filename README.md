# Why the Hypothesis that Any Universe That Can Exist Do Exist Can Be Derived From The Occam's Razor
Why Occam's razor and the minimal information argument lead to the conclusion that every logical consistent universe that can exist must exist.

General Argument:
Physics tells us a lot about our universe, but cannot prove or disprove the existence of other universes with other laws of physics. While we can rely on math to exclude the existence of universes that are inconsistent logically. There is still the possibility for an infinite amount of universes with infinite different laws of physics, which we cannot prove or disprove based on any observation or experiment. The goal of this document is to show that the possibility in which any universe that can exist must exist is the simplest and contains the least information compared to all other hypotheses (Such as the hypothesis that only this universe exists, or only a set of specific universes exist).  Therefore based on Occamâ€™s razor the most likely hypothesis.
The importance of simplicity and minimum information
Simplicity, Occam's razor, and Kolmogorov complexity assumptions   are all different names for prioritizing simple explanations over hypotheses that are consistent with the data but are more  complex.
The minimum information principle is the guiding principle in any hypothesis selection in data analysis and science when several different hypotheses are supported by the same empirical evidence. Hence, it's perhaps the best and most used principle for selecting explanations and theories with the same set of predictions.


The proof is presented in two different forms in the next sections.
Proof version 1 (longer more formal):
Assumptions/Axioms.
1) The Ockham razor states that given several models that fit a given data, the simplest one should be used. Expressing this as the minimum information principle means that the model that has minimal information and hence takes minimal information to describe or transmit should be used. 
Proof/Argument:
Let's define a set of all possible universes. 
We take p is the fraction of universes that exists in the set of all possible universes. Clearly,  each hypothesis must give a single value of p directly derived from the hypothesis.
Hence, p is the minimum amount of information any hypothesis must hold.
For a hypothesis with  p=0 or p=1, the hypothesis is fully defined by the value of p. Hence, it's possible to determine that every universe  in the set exists based on the value of p alone. However, for other values p the hypothesis must contain additional information to decide whether a given universe  exists.
Hence hypotheses with p=0 and p=1 have minimum information.
p=0 means no universe exists. Since  we know our universe exists this option is inconsistent with the facts.
p=1 means all possible universes exist and it's consistent with the fact this universe exists(P>0).
Hence, according to the Ockham razor (expressed as minimum information principle) any universe that can possibly exist does exist.  Where the set of universes that can possibly exist might be defined as the set of programs that can run on an infinite universal Turing machine 







Proof version 2 (shorter less formal):
.
Assumptions/Axioms
The Ockham razor, which states that given several hypotheses that fit a given data, the simplest one should be used. Expressing this as the minimum information principle means that the hypothesis that has the minimal information should be used (In this case we will refer to information as entropy).

We create a set of all possible universes that can exist.
Let's take p as the fraction of all universes  in the set that  exists according to a given hypothesis.
The entropy from this hypothesis  is S=-p*log(p)-(1-p)*log(1-p).
Now, this entropy is at a minimum at one of two states: p=0 and p=1.
p=0 means no universe exists. Since this universe exists, this option is not valid.
p=1 means all possible universes exist.

Hence, the Ockham razor (expressed as the minimum information principle) leads to the idea that all possible universes that can exist do  exist.
